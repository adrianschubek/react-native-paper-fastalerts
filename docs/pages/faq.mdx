### How to prevent duplicate alerts?

Simply set the `key` option to a specific value. If a new alert with the same key is triggered while the old one is active or queued, this new alert will be dismissed and never displayed.

```tsx
alert({
  key: "im-unique",
  title: "Hello World!",
});

alert({
  // this alert will be dismissed immediately
  key: "im-unique",
  title: "Goodbye World!",
});
```

### How can I get the values from a `select` or `search-select` as an array?
Use the `toArray` method to convert the value to an array.
```tsx
import { toArray } from "react-native-paper-fastalerts";
```
```tsx
alert({
  okAction(values) {
    const arr = toArray(values[0]); // e.g: ->  ["b", "l", "m"]
  },
  fields: [
    {
      type: "select",
      data: [
        { key: "Berlin", value: "b" },
        { key: "Paris", value: "p" },
        { key: "London", value: "l" },
        { key: "Madrid", value: "m" },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```
Internally the `select` and `search-select` fields store the values as a concatenated string with a separator.

### Do `action`, `okAction` and `cancelAction` support async functions?

Yes.

### What options are required?

None. All options are optional.

### What is the difference between `alert`, `confirm`, `success`, ...?

The only difference is that some options such as `icon` and `title` are set to a default value. However you can override and use any of them for any purpose.

### I want to use a custom component inside the alert. How can I do that?

Use the `custom` field type.
  
```tsx
alert({
  fields: [{
    type: "custom",
    render(value, setValue, allValues, tempValue, setTempValue) {
      return <MyComponent />
    },
  }]
})
```
