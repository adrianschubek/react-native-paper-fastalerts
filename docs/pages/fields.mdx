# Fields

Fields are the basic building blocks of a form. They are the elements that the user interacts with. They can be text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons or even custom components that you create.

Most fields have an internal state that is updated when the user interacts with them. For example, a text field has a value that is updated when the user types text into it. A checkbox has a checked state that is updated when the user clicks on it.

All these input values will be passed to an [action handler](actions.mdx) when the user for example presses the alert buttons ('OK', 'Cancel').

An alert can contain any number of fields. The `fields` property is an array of field objects. Each object has at least a `type` attribute that determines what kind of field it is.

```tsx {3-7}
alert({
  title: "What is the capital of Germany?",
  fields: [
    {
      type: "text",
    },
  ],
});
```
