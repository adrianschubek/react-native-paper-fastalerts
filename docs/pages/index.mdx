# Welcome!

**react-native-paper-fastalerts** is a **performant** and easy to use library for **alerts** and **dialogs** which can be used in any React Native application. It has **many complex input fields** (such as [Virtualized Search Selectboxes](/fields/search-select.mdx)) **built-in** and is **easy to integrate** in both new and existing projects.

## Features

 ✅ **Easy to integrate and use**

No Provider needed. Alert configuration is optional and it can all be set using a single object.

 ✅ **Feature rich field library**

Many input fields are already **built-in** from simple Text fields to FlatList-based Radiobuttons with a Search option.

 ✅ **Lightweight and performant**

We use [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) as our state management library which is very lightweight and performant compared to React Context.

 ✅ **Customizable**

The UI is built on top of [react-native-paper](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper) with full support for its darkmode and theme colors. The alert styles can easily be customized.

 ✅ **Expo and Web compatible**
