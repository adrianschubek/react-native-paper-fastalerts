# Options

All options are optional. The options object provided by the user will override the default alert options. That means the following is a valid alert configuration:

```tsx
alert({});
```

Many options can be set to `""` to hide them from the alert and the styling will also reflect this.

### Title & Message

```tsx {2,3}
alert({
  title: "Hello World",
  message: "This is an alert message",
});
```

### Icons

By default icons Material Design icons are used. You can find them out [here](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/)

```tsx {2}
alert({
  icon: "account",
});
```

### Alert Buttons

An alert can contain up to two dialog buttons.

```tsx {2,3}
alert({
  okText: "First",
  cancelText: "Second",
})
```

Only show one button:

```tsx {3}
alert({
  okText: "First",
  cancelText: "",
})
```

### Prevent closing by clicking outside

```tsx {2}
alert({
  dismissable: false,
})
```

### Hide background behind alert

```tsx {2}
alert({
  cover: true,
})
```

### Prevent duplicates

You can use the `key` option to prevent duplicate alerts from being shown. If a new alert with the same key is triggered while the old one is active or queued, this new alert will be dismissed and never displayed.

```tsx {2,8}
alert({
  key: "im-unique",
  title: "Hello World!",
});

alert({
  // this alert will be dismissed immediately
  key: "im-unique",
  title: "Goodbye World!",
});
```
