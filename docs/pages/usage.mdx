# Usage Guide

## Basics

When you call an alert function, the alert is added to a queue. The queue is processed in order, so you can call multiple alerts in a row and they will be shown one after another. Only one alert can be active (= shown) at a time though.

Alerts can be called from anywhere in your app, even from within other alerts and share values between them which makes chaining alerts/dialogs super easy.

## Container

We do not need to wrap React in a provider but we still need some way to display the alerts. For this we use the `AlertContainer` component. It should be placed at the root of your app, so alerts can be displayed anywhere in the app. Its responsibility is to display the active alert.

```tsx filename="App.tsx" {1,6}
import { AlertContainer } from "react-native-paper-fastalerts";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <AlertContainer />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Hook

Use the `useAlerts` hook to trigger alerts and dialogs in your app. 

```tsx {1,4,7}
import { useAlerts } from "react-native-paper-fastalerts";

export default function Foo() {
  const alerts = useAlerts();
  return (
    <View>
      <Button onPress={() => alerts.info({title: "It works"})}>Alert</Button>
    </View>
  );
}
```
You may also use [object destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) instead to get the individual alert functions.

```tsx {4,7}
import { useAlerts } from "react-native-paper-fastalerts";

export default function Foo() {
  const { info } = useAlerts();
  return (
    <View>
      <Button onPress={() => info({title: "It works"})}>Alert</Button>
    </View>
  );
}
```

`useAlerts` returns an object with alert functions with some default values. 
An alert function accepts a single parameter [`options`](options.mdx) which contains every option that can be passed to an alert. 

Currently these functions are available:
- `alert(options)`
- `success(options)`
- `info(options)`
- `error(options)`
- `warning(options)`
- `confirm(options)`

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
The only difference between these functions is the default initial value of `options`. For example a `confirm` alert has its buttons set to 'Ok' and 'Cancel'. You can override these default values by just setting a value in the `options` object. So you can technically use any of these functions for any alert type.
